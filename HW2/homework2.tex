def findVisibleSegments(segments, p):
    An "event" defined to be "start" and "end" points of a segments
    # Applying MergeSort Or Similar Approach.
    # Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
    Events are sorted based on the angle from the point p to the start or end point
    
    We start at angle 0, and we split all segments at angle 0 into two segments
    # Avoid Duplicate Counting
    But, we increase the count only once for a segment if both segment-pieces are counted

    Define "Active" as a balanced binary tree using a "dynamic comparator"
    Define "VisibleSeg" as a set stored visible segement candidate.
    Given an angle a, compare the segments based on the "distance" from p at angle a

    While events are non-empty:
        a = angle of current event
        if current event is a start point:
            # Comparison can be made in O(logn) time by "dynamic comparator"
            if the segement is less than all other elements in Active:
                count += 1
                add segement to VisibleSeg
            add segement to Active

\section*{Question 8}
The following code addressed the problem: counting intersections of axis-aligned segments in $O(n log n)$ time. Note that the codec is implemented in \textit{Python}.
\\
The algorithm uses a sweep-line technique combined with a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) to achieve this time complexity.
Segments are represented with endpoints and classified as horizontal or vertical; y-coordinates are compressed into integer indices for efficient BIT operations. 
Events are created: horizontal segments generate add and remove events at their x-endpoints, while vertical segments generate query events at their x-coordinate. 
Events are sorted by x-coordinate, processing adds before queries and queries before removes when x-values are equal. 
As the sweep line advances, the BIT maintains the active set of horizontal segments' y-indices. 
During query events, the BIT efficiently counts active horizontal segments overlapping the vertical segment's y-range.
Noticing that BIT costs \( O(\log n) \) time updates and queries. Hence, the sweep line framework achieves the \( O(n \log n) \) time complexity.
\\
\textit{*Note that this algorithm does not consider the case when horizontal (vertical) segment overlapping with the same horizontal (vertical) segment.}

\section*{Question 9}
Picked Probelm: \textbf{Simple Linear-Time Polygon Triangulation} 
\\
\url{https://topp.openproblem.net/p10}

\subsection*{Problem Description:}
Polygon triangulation involves partitioning a simple polygon into non-overlapping triangles.
The primary challenge lies in achieving efficient algorithms that perform this triangulation in linear time, especially for large and complex polygons.

\subsection*{Approaches and Recent Developments:}
Chazelle's [1] groundbreaking 1991 algorithm was the first to achieve deterministic linear-time triangulation of a simple polygon. However, its complexity has driven researchers to seek simpler yet efficient alternatives. Recent (But not that recent) advancements include both deterministic and randomized algorithms that strive to match or approach linear-time performance with greater simplicity:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Deterministic Linear-Time Algorithm: }
    A new approach leverages the polygon-cutting and planar separator theorems to build a coarse triangulation in a bottom-up phase, followed by a top-down refinement [2]. This method avoids complex data structures like dynamic search trees, relying instead on elementary structures, thus simplifying implementation compared to Chazelle's algorithm.
    \item \textbf{Randomized Algorithms: }
    One algorithm computes the trapezoidal decomposition of a simple polygon in expected linear time, enabling linear-time triangulation through known reductions. It simplifies Chazelle's method by performing random sampling  [3] on subchains of the polygon rather than its edges.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Possible Thoughts For Approaching (Topological Approach):}
To develop a simple linear-time algorithm for polygon triangulation, we can use the ear clipping method. [4]
First, decompose the polygon into monotone pieces using an \( O(n) \) algorithm (there exists a few currently).
Then, apply a simplified ear clipping method to each monotone piece.
An "ear" is a triangle formed by three consecutive vertices that lies entirely inside the polygon without containing any other vertices. 
Since ear clipping operates efficiently on monotone polygons, this approach achieves an overall linear-time (\( O(n) + O(n) \sim O(2n) \)) algorithm and might be considered running in a simpler manner by avoiding complex data structures. 
By clipping off ears sequentially, the polygon is completely and efficiently triangulated.
