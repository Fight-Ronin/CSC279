\section*{Question 10}

\subsection*{(PART A)}
\textbf{Parametrizing the Segment pq: }
\\
Let $p = (x_0, y_0)$ and $q = (x_1, y_1)$ be the endpoints of the segment $pq$. Any point $x(t)$ on $pq$ can 
be expressed as: 
\[ x(t) = (1 - t)p + tq = ((1 - t)x_0 + tx_1, (1 - t)y_0 + ty_1), \ t \in [0, 1] \]
\textbf{Dual Lines Corresponding to Points on pq: }
\\
The dual line $\hat{x}(t)$ Corresponding to $x(t)$ is:
\[ y = A(t)x - B(t) \]
where:
\[ A(t) = (1 - t)x_0 + tx_1 \]
\[ B(t) = (1 - t)y_0 + ty_1 \]
Now we can express rewrite the equation of $\hat{x}(t)$ as:
\[ y = [x_0 + t(x_1 - x_0)]x - [y_0 + t(y_1 - y_0)] \]
\[ = x_0x - y_0 + t[(x_1 - x_0)x - (y_1 - y_0)] \]
Let:
\[ D = (x_1 - x_0)x - (y_1 - y_0) \]
Then:
\[ y = x_0x - y_0 + tD \]
For a fixed $x$, $y$ varies linearly with $t$ from $y = x_0x - y_0$ (when $t = 0$) to $y = x_1x - y_1$ (when $t = 1$).
The Union of all dual lines $\hat{x}(t)$ for $t \in [0,1]$ is the set of all points $(x, y)$ in the plane satisfying:
\[ \min(y_0, y_1) \leq y - x \cdot \min(x_0, x_1) \leq \max(y_0, y_1) \]
Equivilantly, by eliminating parameter $t$, we can get similar inequality:
\\
We aim to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the parametric equations to describe the union of dual lines \(\hat{x}(t)\).
\\
Solving for \( t \):
\[
t = \frac{y - x_0 x + y_0}{D}
\]
\textbf{Note:} The sign of \( D \) affects the inequality direction.
\\
If \( D > 0 \), then
\[ 0 \leq \frac{y - x_0 x + y_0}{D} \leq 1 \Rightarrow 0 \leq y - x_0 x + y_0 \leq D \]
\\
If \( D < 0 \), then
\[ 0 \geq \frac{y - x_0 x + y_0}{D} \geq 1 \Rightarrow D \leq y - x_0 x + y_0 \leq 0 \]
\\
Both cases can be unified by the product inequality:
\[ (y - x_0 x + y_0)(y - x_1 x + y_1) \leq 0 \]
This inequality describes the region between the lines \( y = x_0 x - y_0 \) and \( y = x_1 x - y_1 \), where the expressions \( y - x_0 x + y_0 \) and \( y - x_1 x + y_1 \) have opposite signs or are zero.
\\
Hence, the union of all dual lines is:
\[ (y - x_0 x + y_0)(y - x_1 x + y_1) \leq 0 \]
This inequality describes all points $(x, y)$ that lie between $y = x_0x - y_0$, $y = x_1x - y_1$. 
which forms a region called a "double wedge".

\subsection*{(PART B)}
\begin{verbatim}
Input:
    S = { s_i | i = 1 to n }
output:
    l_max # Line has max. intersections point with other sections

Algorithm FindMaxIntersectingLine(S): 
    Initialize an empty list L_dual_lines.

    For each segement s_i in S do:
        Let p_i = (x_{0i}, y_{0i}) and q_i = (x_{1i}, y_{1i})
        Compute the dual lines:
            L_{p_i}: y = x_{0i} x - y_{0i}
            L_{q_i}: y = x_{1i} x - y_{1i}
        Add L_{p_i} and L_{q_i} to L_dual_lines.

    Construct the arrangement A of the lines in L_dual_lines:
        # TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n^2logn)
        Use the line sweep algorithm to compute the A.
        Store the faces, edges, and vertices of the A.

    Initialize count c_f = 0 for a starting PLANE f_0 at INFINITY

    Traverse arrangement A to label each face with the number 
    of double wedges covering it: 
        # TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n^2)
        For each edge e in A:
            Determine which double wedges have boundaries along e
            For each face f adjacent to e:
                *c_{f'} is the count of the adjacent face before crossing e
                If crossing e enters a double wedge W_i, then c_f = c_{f'} + 1
                If crossing e exits a double wedge W_i, then c_f = c_{f'} - 1
    
    Keep track of the face f_max with the maximum count c_max during traversal
    
    Let (a_max, b_max) be a point inside face f_max.

    Compute the line l_max in the primal plane corresponding to (a_max, b_max):
        l_max: y = a_max x - b_max

    Return l_max
\end{verbatim}
\\
\textbf{A more general description of the Algorithm: }
\\
The algorithm leverages \textit{duality} by transforming each segment's endpoints into lines in the dual plane, resulting in \textit{double wedges}. This transformation converts the original problem into finding a point in the dual plane that lies within the maximum number of double wedges, which corresponds to a line in the original plane intersecting the most segments.
\\
The algorithm employs the \textit{line-sweeping} paradigm by sweeping a line (e.g., vertically) across the dual plane. As the sweep line moves, it records events where it crosses dual lines---these events correspond to entering or exiting double wedges. By updating a count of active double wedges at each event and keeping track of the maximum count throughout the sweep, the algorithm identifies the point where the maximum overlap occurs. 
This point corresponds to the desired line in the original plane that intersects the most segments.

\section*{Question 11}
\begin{verbatim}
Input: 
    Simple polygon P given as a list of vertices [v1, v2, ..., vn] in order
Output: 
    Whether there exists a line l such that P is monotone w.r.t. l

Algorithm DetermineMonotonicity(P):
    BadIntervals = empty_list()
    # TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
    For i from i to n:
        v_prev = P[(i - 2) mod n]
        v = P[i - 1]
        v_next = P[i mod n]
        Compute vectors e1 = v - v_prev
        Compute vectors e2 = v_next - v
        Compute cross product cp = e1.x * e2.y - e1.y * e2.x
        If cp < 0 (vertex is concave):
            Compute angles a1 = atan2(e1.y, e1.x) mod 2PI
            Compute angles a2 = atan2(e2.y, e2.x) mod 2PI

            Let Interval = [a2, a1] if a1 > a2 else [a2, a1 + 2PI]
            Normalize Interval to [0, 2PI)

            Add Interval to BadIntervals

    # TIME COMPLEXITY: O(nlogn)
    Sort BadIntervals by their start angles
    Merge overlapping intervals in BadIntervals to get a list of disjoint intervals

    If the merged intervals cover [0, 2PI):
        return FALSE

    return TRUE
\end{verbatim}
\\
\textbf{A more general description of the Algorithm: }
\\
For each vertex \(i\), determine if it is concave using the \textbf{counterclockwise (ccw)} test. If the ccw sign at the vertex differs from the majority, mark it as concave. For each concave vertex, compute two vectors:
\[
    c_0 = v(i) - v(i-1), \quad c_1 = v(i+1) - v(i).
\]
Calculate their angles \(a_0\) and \(a_1\) using the \texttt{atan2} function, normalized to \([0, 2\pi)\):
\[
    a_0 = (\text{atan2}(c_0.y, c_0.x) + 2\pi) \bmod 2\pi, \quad a_1 = (\text{atan2}(c_1.y, c_1.x) + 2\pi) \bmod 2\pi.
\]
Store the interval \([a_1, a_0]\) in a list.
\\
After processing all vertices, sort the intervals and merge any overlapping ones. If the merged intervals cover the full \(2\pi\) range, the polygon is \textbf{not monotone}. Otherwise, it is \textbf{monotone}.

\section*{Question 12}
\begin{verbatim}
Input: 
    RedPoints = [ (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn) ]
    BluePoints = [ (x1', y1'), (x2', y2'), ..., (xn', yn') ]
Output:
    Coefficients (a, b, c) defining the parabola y = a x^2 + b x + c
    or report "No solution exists" if impossible

Algorithm FindSeparatingParabola(RedPoints, BluePoints): 
    Initialize an empty list Constraints = []

    # NOTE: e is a small positive number
    For each red point (x_i, y_i) in RedPoints do:
        Make inequality:
            a (x_i^2) + b (x_i) + c - y_i < 0
        Convert to standard LP form (inequalities with <=):
            a (x_i^2) + b (x_i) + c - y_i <= -e
        Add this to Constraints

    For each blue point (x_j, y_j) in RedPoints do:
        Make inequality:
            a x_j^2 + b x_j + c - y_j > 0
        Convert to standard LP form (inequalities with <=):
            -a x_j^2 - b x_j - c + y_j <= -e

    Solution = LinearProgramming(Constraints, ObjectiveFunction)

    If Solution is feasible then:
       Output "Parabola found with coefficients:"
       Output "a =", Solution.a
       Output "b =", Solution.b
       Output "c =", Solution.c

    Output "No solution exists"

\section*{Question 13}
\begin{align*}
    \text{min } & R - r \\
    \text{subject to: } & x^2 - 2xc + c^2 <= R \\
                        & x^2 - 2xc + c^2 >= r \\
\end{align*}
\\
We cam remove $c^2$ since it is a common term to all Constraints.

\begin{align*}
    \text{min } & R - r \\
    \text{subject to: } & x^2 - 2xc <= R \\
                        & x^2 - 2xc >= r \\
\end{align*}
\\
Since $c^2$ is common to all constraints, so $c^2$ is in fact a constant for all. Although the value of $c^2$ changes according to $c$, 
it remain relatively common to all constraints. So in here, for the upward's constraints, we are making $R$ and $r$ $c^2$ smaller that their actual values.
And noticing our LP is focusing on minimizing the difference between $R$ and $r$, subtracting $c^2$ to both of them will not make differences. 

Overall, the solution will be in the ideal form (i.e. pi(R - r))
